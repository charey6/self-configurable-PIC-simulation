## Description
Download the files and unzip. Run the Python code for simulation of automated minimization of output ports, which is the algorithm introduced in the following paper:
[1] D. A. B. Miller, Opt. Express 2013, 21, 6360.
The simulation runs two different cases, with and without independent phase control. The simulation shows that lack of independent phase control can lead to significant performance degradation. This is part of a project performed in University of Washington. The paper will be submitted soon.
